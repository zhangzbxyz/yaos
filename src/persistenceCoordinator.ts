	 * Decide how to relieve a journal that has grown, and do it.

	 *   entry count — makes cold load slow, because replay cost is dominated by
	 *                 the number of applyUpdate calls rather than by bytes.
	 *   journal size relative to the snapshot — makes writes wasteful, because
	 *                 a checkpoint rewrites the whole snapshot.
	 *
	 * The shipping policy answered both with a checkpoint, which is O(snapshot)
	 * and therefore the wrong tool for the first: it rewrote the entire vault
	 * every ~51 saves no matter how large the vault or how small the deltas.
	 * Coalescing answers entry-count pressure in O(journal) instead, and leaves
	 * checkpoints for the case that actually needs one.
	 *
	 * The byte trigger keeps its absolute floor so small vaults behave as before,
	 * and gains a relative arm so large ones stop scaling their amplification
	 * with their own size.
