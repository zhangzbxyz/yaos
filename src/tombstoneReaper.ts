/**
 * Tombstone body reaper.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Deleting a file in YAOS writes a tombstone into `meta` and leaves the file's
 * `Y.Text` body in `idToText` untouched.  Nothing ever removes it:
 * `pruneOrphans` explicitly exempts tombstoned ids from cleanup, so the body is
 * unreachable, still "live" as far as Yjs is concerned, and therefore exempt
 * from garbage collection forever.
 *
 * Yjs GC is not at fault and is not disabled — `gc: true` is the default and
 * collapsing works exactly as documented.  Deleting the map entry that holds a
 * Y.Text recursively replaces its content with GC structs, which is why a
 * 200KB body collapses to ~37 encoded bytes.  We simply never asked.
 *
 * The result is a document that grows with the vault's LIFETIME content rather
 * than its CURRENT content: on one real vault, 46 tombstones were retaining
 * 404,641 characters, 11.5% of the document, and that share only ever rises.
 * At the memory ratios measured on the same deployment (~13 bytes of DO heap
 * per character) that is the difference between a vault that fits in 128MB and
 * one that does not.
 *
 * WHY REAPING IS SAFE
 *
 * Deleting a body is an ordinary CRDT delete, so it converges: a peer that
 * edited the file offline and merges afterwards agrees with the reaping peer
 * byte-for-byte, and no content resurrects.  The `meta` tombstone is
 * deliberately NOT removed, so resurrection prevention, the tombstone-conflict
 * reconcile path, and revive-blocking all behave exactly as before.
 *
 * Reviving a file never reads the retained body: `ensureFile` clears the meta
 * tombstone and then mints a fresh fileId and a fresh Y.Text from disk content.
 *
 * WHAT THE GRACE PERIOD PROTECTS
 *
 * One consumer does read the body.  When a remote delete reaches a device,
 * DiskMirror looks up `idToText` to obtain a baseline and compares it against
 * the file on disk, so it can preserve a file the user modified locally instead
 * of deleting it.  With no baseline it fails safe — it PRESERVES the file and
 * marks it unresolved — so a device that has been offline longer than the grace
 * period keeps its local copy rather than losing edits.  That is the worst case,
 * and it lands in the existing tombstone-conflict path.  The grace window
 * therefore only needs to exceed how long a device plausibly stays offline.
 *
 * WHY THIS DEPENDS ON THE DIRTY-FLAG FIX
 *
 * A reap is a deletion-only change, which does not advance the state vector.
 * While saves were gated on state-vector equality the reap was computed, applied
 * in memory, reported as a successful save, and never written — reverting on the
 * next cold load.  See PersistenceCoordinator's `dirty` flag.
